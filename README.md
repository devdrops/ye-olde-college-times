# Ye Olde College Times

I must say honestly that most of the code from this time was created by my colleagues. I owe you guys very much!

This is an attempt to make me remember those times, to say thanks to everyone I've had the opportunity to work with and to show how awful I was at coding. Maybe someday I'll become an awesome programmer.
